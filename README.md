## Volumes

* `/data`: Contains configuration and the downloaded EJT License Server unix tarball

In this folder you will find those files:

* `ejtserver_unix_*.tar.gz`: The downloaded EJT License Server unix tarball
* `ip.txt`: If you would like to allow only certain IP addresses, enter one IP address per line. If no IP addresses are entered, all IP addresses will be allowed. You can specify IP masks, such as 192.168.2.*
* `users.txt`: If you would like to allow only certain user names, please enter one user name per line. If no user names are entered, all user names will be allowed

> :warning: Note that the volumes should be owned by the user/group with the specified `PUID` and `PGID`. If you don't give the volume correct permissions, the container may not start.

## Ports

* `11862`: License server port

## Commands

You also have access to these commands from the container:

* `ejtserver`: This is the license server the daemon launch script. Commands available: `start|stop|run|run-redirect|status|restart|force-reload`.
* `admin`: Admin tool command line based of ejtserver. It allows you to list all active connections and to terminate selected connections. In addition, you can check out a temporary license for use in environments that have no access to the floating license server

Usage:

```bash
docker-compose exec ejtserver admin list
```

## Usage

### Docker Compose

Docker compose is the recommended way to run this image. Copy the content of folder
[examples/compose](examples/compose) in `/var/ejtserver/` on your host for example. Edit the compose and env files with
your preferences and run the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Command line

You can also use the following minimal command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 11862:11862 --name ejtserver \
  -e TZ="Europe/Paris" \
  -e EJT_ACCOUNT_USERNAME="my_ejt_username" \
  -e EJT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD="my_ejt_password" \
  -e EJTSERVER_LICENSES="0-0123-0123456789" \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/data \
  crazymax/ejtserver:latest
```

## Upgrade

Recreate the container whenever I push an update:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## Notes

### How to use your floating license?

[ej-technologies'](https://www.ej-technologies.com/) products offer a floating license mode in the license dialog.
Choose `Help -> Enter License Key` from the main menu in the JProfiler GUI or the install4j IDE and select
the **Floating license** radio button.

The "Name" and "Company" fields are informational only, unless you choose to restrict the allowed values for the
"Name" field as described in README.TXT. In the license server field you have to enter the hostname of the computer
where the license server is running. Instead of a host name, an IP address can also be used.

If have a floating license for a certain major version of a product, you can use older versions of the same product
with that floating license as well.

Should you require any additional assistance, please contact **support@ej-technologies.com**

### User groups

If you want to partition keys to different groups of users, you can define groups in the file `license.txt` and the
access control files `users.txt` and `ip.txt` by inserting group headers:

```
   [group]
```

All entries after a group header belong to that group until a new group is started. If no group has been started,
entries are added to the "default" group.

Users are assigned to a group based on the defined groups in the access control files. If users are defined in
`users.txt`, the group is determined by the that file. If the resulting group is the default group, the `ip.txt` file
will be used for determining the associated group. If the users.txt file is empty, only the ip.txt file will be used.

In order to partition a single key to different groups in the `license.txt` file, add the key to multiple groups
with the following syntax:

```
   n:key
```

where n is the number of concurrent users that should be assigned to the current group. Use different values of n
in different groups that add up to the maximum number of current users for the key. For example:

```
[groupA]
4:F-95-10-xxx
[groupB]
6:F-95-10-xxx
```

splits the 10-user key F-95-10-xxx into 4 concurrent users for `[groupA]` and 6 concurrent users for `[groupB]`.
In `users.txt`, the groups would be defined as:

```
[groupA]
bob
alice
...


[groupB]
carol
john
...
```

Alternatively, the `ip.txt` file could define groups as:

```
[groupA]
192.162.1.*
[groupB]
192.162.2.*
```

Group names are shown in the log file next to the user name.
